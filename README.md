# Truffle BF

A [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/brainfuck) (short BF) implementation using Truffle for the GraalVM.

BF is a famous esoteric language invented by the Swiss Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993, in an attempt to make a language for which he could write the smallest possible compiler for the Amiga OS, version 2.0. Instead of beeing as small as possible, this implementations aims to be as fast as possible by leveraging dynamic speculation with Truffle and Graal.

## BF Short Reference

Brainfuck operates on an array of memory cells, also referred to as the tape, each initially set to zero. There is a pointer, initially pointing to the first memory cell. The commands are:

| Command | Description                                                          |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| >       | Move the pointer to the right                                        |
| <       | Move the pointer to the left                                         |
| +       | Increment the memory cell under the pointer                          |
| -       | Decrement the memory cell under the pointer                          |
| .       | Output the character signified by the cell at the pointer            |
| ,       | Input a character and store it in the cell at the pointer            |
| [       | Jump past the matching ] if the cell under the pointer is 0          |
| ]       | Jump back to the matching [ if the cell under the pointer is nonzero |


All characters other than ><+-.,[] should be considered comments and ignored.
